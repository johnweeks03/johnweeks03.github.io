<p class="ltx_p">Sal, a newly-hired police offer, has written a number of parking violations this week. She receives an angry email from one of the violators asking why they received a $100 fine.

Help her sort out her paperwork and find out which car received the $100 fine. (No option in any category will ever be used more than once.)</p>

<div id="S0.SS1.SSS1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">For example, since there are four cars in this problem, item 2 tells us that the Dartson and Etsalle don’t have SVZ-880 plates, and they weren’t the ones that received the $100 fine. Referencing item 4, the Cavalo had to be the one with the RBD-337 plate as item 3 says that Etsalle was the one that was fined $50. Hence combining this with what we know from item 2 again, the Hornet had to be the car with the SVZ-880 plate, and the Cavalo was the one that received the $100 fine.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">Oh my goodness, I forgot you all were there! Did you follow what I was saying? Some of you did (maybe), and some of you didn’t. Even if you have been studying mathematics for a while now, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">you may not have received formal training in mathematical logic</span>. Up to now it’s largely because the need for you to be trained in logic was minimal, as we instructors have been communicating the logic that other mathematicians have been giving you.

Any teacher will tell you they are wrong, because more and more they are discovering that their students are needing to learn subjects like <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">graph theory</span> and data science in order to open up their students’ future vocations in mathematics. Anyone who has opened up the <a href="https://arxiv.org/archive/math">arXiv</a> will be floored at how many papers of new mathematics are being posted by mathematicians around the world every single day. <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">In order to prepare you for the next stage of your mathematical career, we must train you in logic.

That’s the mistake I made in the logic puzzle: while I was explaining the logic that was going on in my head, I could have explained it better.

<p class="ltx_p">Well, for one thing, I could have given a deeper explanation for my logical conclusions. Why is the Cavalo the one that received the $100 fine? I’m going to take a deep breath and explain my reasoning below:</p>

I know the cars must be all different in this list because there are four cars and four descriptions, so they must match one-to-one.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">Notice how much easier it is to follow this train of thought. It may take a few times to read through these items, but hopefully you are now convinced that my reasoning is correct!

<div id="S0.SS1.SSS4.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">In 1976 Irme Lakatos wrote a book called <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Proofs and Refutations: The Logic of Mathematical Discovery</span>. In the book a group of students have dialogue about a concept called the Euler characteristic, which is presented as a conjecture: “for all polyhedra <math id="S0.SS1.SSS4.p1.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="V-E+F=2" display="inline"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>V</mi><mo>−</mo><mi>E</mi></mrow><mo>+</mo><mi>F</mi></mrow><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></math>, where <math id="S0.SS1.SSS4.p1.m2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="V" display="inline"><mi>V</mi></math> is the number of vertices, <math id="S0.SS1.SSS4.p1.m3" class="ltx_Math" alttext="E" display="inline"><mi>E</mi></math> the number of edges, and <math id="S0.SS1.SSS4.p1.m4" class="ltx_Math" alttext="F" display="inline"><mi>F</mi></math> the number of faces.” I have included a tract from Lakatos’s text in this link so you can read some of this conversation.</p>

<div id="S0.SS1.SSS4.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">It may surprise you that the conversation about something quite well known in mathematical circles very quickly goes off the rails. For something as well-discussed as this Euler characteristic, it is very hard to prove it to be true for <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">all</span> polyhedra. In the text, the teacher presents a “proof” by showing it to be true specifically for cubes, but the students begin to pose several counterarguments. To summarize the students’ questions:</p>
<ol id="S0.I4" class="ltx_enumerate">

<p class="ltx_p">What counts as a polyhedron? This is a <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">dispute of definition</span>. This is important, as a sphere has 1 face, no vertices, and no edges, so it does not satisfy the Euler characteristic.</p>

</li>
<li id="S0.I4.i2" class="ltx_item" style="list-style-type:none;">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_item">2.</span> 
<div id="S0.I4.i2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">Given we have defined polyhedra, why does showing a proof of the fact <math id="S0.I4.i2.p1.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="V-E+F=2" display="inline"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>V</mi><mo>−</mo><mi>E</mi></mrow><mo>+</mo><mi>F</mi></mrow><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></math> works for a cube mean that it works for <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">all</span> polyhedra? The teacher’s proof is known as a <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">“proof” by example</span>, and it doesn’t work well in mathematics, as there could very well be examples that show the opposite of what we wish to prove.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="ltx_p">Some of you may balk at this criticism as being pedantic, because <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">certainly</span> the Euler characteristic <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">has</span> to be true. Why else would we talk about it? But our question boils down to one from the beginning when this formula was first discovered: how do we <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">know</span> that the Euler characteristic is true?</p>

And we can’t build a car without mathematics… we can’t build much of anything these days without mathematics… so our mathematics must be the most sturdy structure of them all.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">I encourage you to look through this proof a few times, as its structure reveals several things I will be looking for in your proofs.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">The proofs are easy to read. Every statement is written as a complete sentence. Notice my use of spacing where each idea is on its own line and how I give a brief explanation of how each step follows from the last.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">Every step contributes to the proof - I didn’t also say something like “the numbers <math id="S0.I5.i2.p1.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="k" display="inline"><mi>k</mi></math> or <math id="S0.I5.i2.p1.m2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\ell" display="inline"><mi mathvariant="normal">ℓ</mi></math> could be even or odd”, as that would not contribute anything to my proof.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">The proof has no meaningful counterargument - I started from a definition we agreed upon, and I ended with a definition we agreed upon, using only deductive techniques from beginning to end.

</li>
</ol>
<p class="ltx_p">Some of you may not agree with me that I successfully addressed item 3: “why is the sum of two integers an integer?” you may ask. Truthfully, I must admit that there are some things that we must agree upon without proof for now. Sometimes it will not be clear what facts from your prior experience in mathematics you are ‘allowed’ to use. Unfortunately, addressing this issue is difficult and is something we will sort out along the way. In this case, basic facts about integers - such as the associative property, commutative property, the zero property, and so on - will be assumed to be true without proofs. These are all actually examples of <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">axioms</span> in our current understanding of the integers, and they are typically accepted without proof. These are discussed at the beginning of MATH 409, and you may find research into basic logic and mathematical axioms to be an interesting topic for your term paper… oh, did I mention there will be a term paper for this course?</p>

<div id="S0.I6.i1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">We will begin by discussing <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">number theory</span> as a vehicle for <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">propositional logic</span> (Chapters 1 &amp; 2). At this stage we will be very formal about our proofs nearly to the point of tedium, explaining how each step follows from either a definition or a prior step we have made. We will use “know-show” tables and other tools to convince others that our proofs are correct.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">We will then introduce some <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">basic set theory</span> (Chapter 4).

<p class="ltx_p">The first thing we will do with sets is build <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">functions</span> (Chapter 5).

<p class="ltx_p">We will end with discussing a bit more <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">number theory</span> (Chapter 6), some <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">relations</span> (Chapter 7) which set up the basis for applications like RSA cryptography, and if time permits we will discuss <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">cardinality</span> (Chapter 8), also known as “the exploration of infinity.” Perhaps “infinity” should be pluralized, as we would be exploring more than one infinity!</p>

<p class="ltx_p">One of my former students said they found success in a course very similar to this (MATH 409) by doing the following:</p>
<blockquote class="ltx_quote">
<p class="ltx_p">I think some of the things that helped me most were definitely making sure the homeworks got done in a timely manner and really trying my best to absorb that material as I came across it.</p>
<p class="ltx_p">I kept an updated list of definitions/propositions/theorems/etc in order and went through their proofs the few days leading up to the exams so that they were fresh on my mind and make sure that I was able to do them on my own.</p>
<p class="ltx_p">It also definitely helped to have a friend in that class to study with, as it’s nice to have different perspectives on how to approach problems!</p>

<p class="ltx_p">The courses that come after this one will take the content from this course for granted. In the case of MATH-409, there <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">may</span> be a one- or two-day review. But MATH-410/415/416/ 423/427/431/433/436/446/447/600+ will assume this content from the beginning. <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">MATH-300 is the gateway to mathematical discovery</span> - it is impossible to access mathematics past this without going through here. By the same token, once you’ve completed this course, the mathematics you can explore busts wide open.</p>
