<h1>Director of Mathematics and Statistics Fair (2023-ongoing)</h1>
<p>Texas A&M University can only survive due to the support of the communities surrounding it. The Mathematics and Statistics Fair is our department's outreach effort to help the future generation discover the beauty of mathematics.</p>

<p>The Fair takes place in the Spring semester of each year and is free to the public. Students may roam around the first floor of Blocker building to visit the various booths, including our Puzzles and Games rooms, our Problem Solving competition, our Arts and Crafts station, as well as a few others hosted by our colleagues and friends.</p>

<p>As the Director I coordinate these booths and advertise the event to the community. We have 250 participants visit with us each year. <a href="https://sites.google.com/tamu.edu/math-and-stat-fair">Here</a> is our website where you can find more information. </p>

<h1>Co-Director of Math Circle (2022-2024)</h1>
<p>Students who are talented in mathematics are typically bored in their mathematics courses in public school. The Math Circle is a continuing outreach event that brings 5th - 12th grade students into direct contact with mathematical professionals in an informal setting to work on fun and interesting topics in mathematics. There are two sessions that take place on most Saturdays in the Blocker building. The Discovery session centers around an inquiry-based interactive activity where students are exposed to mathematical ideas that are well beyond their grade level. The Problem-Solving session prepares students for national competitions in mathematics, such as AMC and MATHCOUNTS, with many of our materials coming from Art of Problem Solving. Both sessions rely heavily on material developed by Texas A&M faculty and students.
    
<p>This organization is a member of the <a href="https://mathcircles.org/">Math Circle Network</a> and hosts activities from the <a href="https://jrmf.org">Julia Robinson Math Festival</a>.</p>

<p>As co-director I developed activities for the Discovery sessions and helped develop a hybrid session for the Advanced Problem-Solving session. We have over 50 participants show up each Saturday. <a href="https://mathcircle.tamu.edu/">Here</a> is our website where you can find more information.</p>
